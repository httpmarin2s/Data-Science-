## Data Science - Book by Joel Grus
* This repository is about my studies of the Data Science book. In my methodology, I prefer reading over watching videos. However, I know that reading and learning are different things. Because of this, I will use this repository to improve my learning process.

## Methodology
* I like to divide my reading process into 4 cycles of 30 minutes each. In each cycle, I do something like this:
* Cycle 1: Read the selected topics from the book.
* Cycles 2 and 3: Do exercises on these topics (and post these exercises here).
* Cycle 4: Review past topics.

## About
** This repository will contain the exercises and data from my daily studies.
